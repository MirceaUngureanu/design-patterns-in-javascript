Single Responsibility states that an Object be responsible for a single unit of work.

Separation of Concerns states that applications should be split into modules whose functionalities overlap as little as possible.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)- give each class just one reason to change; and “Reason to change” == “responsibility”. In example: Invoice class does not have a responsibility to print itself.

Separation of Concerns (since 1974). Concern == feature of system. Taking care of each of the concerns: for each one concern, other concerns are irrelevant. Hiding implementation of behavior.
